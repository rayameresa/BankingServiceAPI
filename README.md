# Banking Service API and Consumer Service

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a backend service (`BankingServiceAPI`) and its event-driven consumer counterpart (`ConsumerService`) for a financial institution. The system provides APIs for managing customers, accounts, and transactions, and integrates with Kafka for event-driven messaging. The service supports features such as account creation, money transfers, and transaction history retrieval, ensuring compliance with the requirements provided.

## Key Features

### BankingServiceAPI
- **Account Management**:
  - Create accounts with an initial deposit (minimum $5).
  - Fetch account details and all accounts with pagination.
- **Customer Management**:
  - Add new customers.
  - Retrieve customer details and all customers with pagination.
- **Transaction Management**:
  - Record transactions.
  - Fetch transaction history for an account.
  - Retrieve filtered transactions based on time range and account ID.
- **Money Transfers**:
  - Transfer amounts between accounts (within and across customers).
  - Publish transfer events to Kafka topics.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**:
  - Publish Kafka events for account creation, transactions, and transfers.

### ConsumerService
- **Event Consumption**:
  - Listens to Kafka topics (`transaction-events`, `account-events`, `customer-events`, `transfer-events`).
  - Logs consumed events for further downstream processing.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Language**: Java (JDK 17)
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka

### Tooling
- **Dependency Management**: Maven
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Logging**: Log4j2

## Prerequisites

1. **Java**: JDK 17+
2. **MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB runs locally or update the `application.properties` with your MongoDB URI.
3. **Kafka and Zookeeper**: Ensure Kafka and Zookeeper are running locally on their default ports (`9092` for Kafka and `2181` for Zookeeper). If using custom ports, update the `application.properties` files.

## Installation and Setup

## MongoDB Setup

1. **Install MongoDB**:
   - Refer to the [MongoDB installation guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) for your operating system.

2. **Start MongoDB**:
   - If installed locally, run:
     ```bash
     mongod
     ```

3. **Access MongoDB CLI**:
   - Open the Mongo shell using:
     ```bash
     mongo
     ```

4. **Create Database**:
   - Create a new database for the project:
     ```bash
     use banking
     ```

5. **Verify MongoDB Connection**:
   - Update `spring.data.mongodb.uri` in `application.properties` if necessary:
     ```properties
     spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/banking
     ```

### Starting Zookeeper and Kafka
1. Start Zookeeper:
   ```bash
   bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
   ```
2. Start Kafka:
   ```bash
   bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
   ```

## How to Run

### BankingServiceAPI
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rayameresa/BankingServiceAPI.git
   cd BankingServiceAPI
   ```
2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Start the service:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Access the API documentation:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
   ```
### ConsumerService
1. Navigate to the ConsumerService folder:
   ```bash
   cd ConsumerService
   ```
2. Build the consumer service:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Start the consumer service:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### API Endpoints

#### BankingServiceAPI

**A. Accounts**
1. Create an account:
   ```bash
    POST /accounts
2. Transfer funds:
   ```bash
    POST /accounts/transfer
3. Get account by ID:
   ```bash
    GET /accounts/{id}
4. Get all accounts (Paginated):
   ```bash
    GET /accounts?page={page}&size={size}
```
**B. Customers**
1. Create a customer:
   ```bash
    POST /customers
2. Get customer by ID:
   ```bash
    GET /customers/{id}
3. Get all customers (Paginated):
   ```bash
    GET /customers?page={page}&size={size}
```
**C. Transactions**
1. Record transactions:
   ```bash
    POST /transactions
2. Get transactions by account ID:
   ```bash
    GET /transactions/{accountId}
3. Get all transactions (Paginated):
   ```bash
    GET /transactions?page={page}&size={size}
4. Filter transactions by time range:
   ```bash
    GET /transactions/filter?accountId={accountId}&from={fromDate}&to={toDate}
```
## Testing
### Event-Driven Workflow
1. Account Creation: Publishes account-events to Kafka.
2. Transaction Recording: Publishes transaction-events to Kafka.
3. Transfer Events: Publishes transfer-events to Kafka.
#### ConsumerService
The consumer service listens to all events (account-events, transaction-events, customer-events, and transfer-events) and logs the payloads.
